**Rolling Bob - 2D Physics-Based Projectile Game Clone**  
Rolling Bob is a 2D physics-based game inspired by Angry Birds, developed using Godot 4 and GDScript. This project served as a great learning experience, covering key Godot concepts such as:  
- Implementing projectile motion with accurate physics.  
- Utilizing **AnimationPlayer** for character and environment animations.  
- Managing game flow with **Timers** and **Markers**.  
- Detecting interactions using **Area2D** and collision layers.  
- Creating functional death zones to handle out-of-bounds objects.  
- Optimizing performance by deleting objects outside the screen.

This project demonstrates core 2D game development skills and is a foundation for more advanced projects.
